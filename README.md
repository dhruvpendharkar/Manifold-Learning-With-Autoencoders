# Manifold-Learning-With-Autoencoders
Using autoencoders to learn image representations and testing classification tasks

Training on Fashion MNIST dataset with goal of learning low dimensional representations of images.
Current Benchmark Autoencoder performance: 
- Training MSE loss of 0.0426
- 20 epoch training
- lr = 0.02

TO DO:

Test image classification results using vanilla-CNN on images and lower dimensional
